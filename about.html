      <h2>About Cat Haven</h2>
      <p>
        Cat Haven is a safe haven for all cats looking for their forever home.
        We provide excellent care, love, and shelter for our cats and help match
        them with their new families. Our mission is to give every cat the
        opportunity to find a loving home.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Since our founding in 2024, Cat Haven has remained dedicated to
        rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming cats of all ages, breeds, and
        backgrounds. We believe that every cat deserves a second chance at life,
        no matter their past. Our mission is simple: to provide a safe, loving
        environment for cats while finding them the perfect family.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Services</h3>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Veterinary Care</strong>: Every cat that comes through our
          doors receives full veterinary care, including vaccinations,
          spaying/neutering, and treatments if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fostering Program</strong>: We work with foster families to
          provide temporary homes for cats while they recover or await adoption.

          <strong>Community Outreach</strong>: We participate in community
          education programs about responsible pet ownership, cat care, and
          adoption.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Our Values</h3>
      <p>
        At Cat Haven, we uphold three key values that guide everything we do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Compassion</strong>: We approach every cat with kindness and
          care, treating each one as an individual with unique needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dedication</strong>: Our staff and volunteers work tirelessly
          to ensure every cat receives the care, attention, and love they need.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsibility</strong>: We believe in educating the public
          about responsible pet ownership and the importance of
          spaying/neutering to prevent overpopulation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
      <p>

      <h3>Our Impact</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to the support of our community, Cat Haven has rehomed over many
        cats since we began. Each adoption is a success story, and we are
        incredibly proud of the work we've done to help cats find their forever
        homes. With your help, we can continue to make a difference, one cat at
        a time.
